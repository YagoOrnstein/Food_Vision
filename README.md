# Food_Vision
Food Vision application with TensorFlow. The model has 101 different kinds of food classes and when we upload our photos and put them into this model it will classify what is the food in that picture. It can be evaluated more in the future.

I used Food101 Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101
You can download the dataset, change the paths in my code, and try the code.
